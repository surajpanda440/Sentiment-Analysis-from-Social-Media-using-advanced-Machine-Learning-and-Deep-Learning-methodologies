# Sentiment-Analysis-from-Social-Media-using-advanced-Machine-Learning-and-Deep-Learning-methodologies
As a part of my final year, I am working on a project focused on sentiment analysis under the guidance of Dr. Mamata Sahu. We are exploring how machine learning and deep learning can be applied to understand human emotions expressed in both social media and review datasets.

Together with my teammates Ishika Rani, Vaibhav Raj, and Nishant Kumar, we are leveraging the Amazon Food Review dataset to analyze sentiments of the food, aiming to provide insights into customer preferences and opinions. Our project will also extend to social media data and images, allowing us to capture a broader spectrum of human sentiment.

What is Sentiment Analysis?🤔🤔
Sentiment analysis is a subfield of natural language processing (NLP) that involves determining the emotional tone behind a series of words. It helps in understanding the attitudes, opinions, and emotions expressed in text data. By utilizing machine learning and deep learning techniques, we can analyze large datasets to identify whether the sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral.😄😡☹️
